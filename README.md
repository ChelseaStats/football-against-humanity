#### Generating the PDFs

I googled around and found a number of generators, but most made smaller cards than I wanted. Then I found this thread on boardgamegeek

Either install https://github.com/bbcards/bbcards somewhere yourself, or run it on this site: http://biggerblackercards.com

Because I wanted to use a different custom logo on white cards vs black, I made two PDFs. That turned out to be good since I needed to print the black cards in color for them to look good, while the white ones were fine in black & white. When I wanted only one, I just made sure the other side (black or white) was blank.

I went with the rectangular 2.5"x3.5" poker-sized cards.

#### Printing

I put the PDFs on a USB stick and had them printed on 110lb cardstock at a local print shop. Any print shop should be able to do this. Cards Against Humanity (in their official printing directions) suggests going with at least 80lb cardstock. The first time I printed this, cutting ~300 cards on the slicing machine took about 45min because I wanted them to look fairly consistent. I could only stack 4 sheets at a time; at 5, the cuts were no longer clean. The second printing, I had the print shop do the cutting. I recommend that over DIY cutting; much much less hassle and cleaner edges.

Cards Against Humanity also suggests printing plain black on the back of the black cards. I made an all-black page in OpenOffice and exported it to PDF. The print shop interleaved the "front" and "back" of the PDFs for me.
